	\page Introduction Introduction to FAAST
	
	FAAST is an open-source C++ library providing strongly object-oriented data
	structures and
	high-performance algorithms for elements and polynomials in Artin-Schreier
	towers over finite fields.
	
	Recall that given a field \b K of characteristic \a p, an Artin-Schreier
	polynomial is a	polynomial of the form
	\f[ X^p - X - a \f]
	where \f$a\f$ is an element of \b K. When such	a polynomial is irreducible,
	its splitting field is called an Artin-Schreier extension of \b K. Extension
	towers of this form are called Artin-Schreier towers and are the main object
	of this library. More details about Artin-Schreier towers can be found in
	[\ref ISSAC "DFS '09"]; that paper is also the source for the majority of the algorithms
	of FAAST.
	
	FAAST uses Victor Shoup's NTL to represent finite field elements and
	polynomials and is conceived as a module on top of it. You don't need to know
	NTL in detail in order to use FAAST, but some familiarity with it is necessary.
	You can download NTL and read its documentation at http://www.shoup.net/ntl/.
	
	FAAST benefits from NTL being used in conjunction with the libraries GMP and
	gf2x. See \ref Install for more details.
	
	FAAST is written and maintained by

	with contributions by
	<a href="http://www.cs.uwo.ca/~eschost">Ã‰ric Schost</a>. It is
